# Compressed Sensing Toolbox
This repository contains routines used in Compressed Sensing that could be used for other projects. This repository is most likely not the best as it is created whilst learning those algorithms. The programmes are not the most optimal and the functions might not be reusable. However, the programmes work as expected and could be used for proof of concept.

## Assignments from Justin Romberg's Tutorial
The folder 'JRom_Tutorial' contains the assignments from Justin Romberg's short course on Compressed Sensing at Tsinghua. The programmes/functions include
- Matching Pursuit
- Orthogonal Matching Pursuit
